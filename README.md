# Rigorously Characterizing Dynamics with Machine Learning

This code accompanies the paper [Rigorously Characterizing Dynamics with Machine Learning]([url](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17302v1)) by Marcio Gameiro, Brittany Gelb, and Konstantin Mischaikow.

We learn neural network approximations to the two-dimensional Leslie model, and then compute Morse graphs and Conley indices using the approximations.
